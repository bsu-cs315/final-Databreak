## Reflection

This third iteration was a clear clean up iteration for the project. Many of the major features that we wanted had been implemented. This iteration had a key focus on making sure that we make things a lot more clear. We had a key point to make sure the player didn't feel lost while playing the game. Having a how to play section that shows the players the basics was our way of doing that. The HUD also got an update making it more clear that you have abilities, and when they can and can't be used. On top of these more clarity centered issues, having a pause menu was another item we implemented so that there was a way to stop playing the game if you just wanted to stop! We also know that we needed some level of fiero, so we made it so that you can jump on an enemy to stop them for a brief time. Overall the group did some good work for this iteration and wrapped to gether a fun and interesting project!
