## Reflection

For this first iteration of the final project, our group is pretty proud with what we have put together so far. We already have a good skeleton to work from and build on top of for the next two iterations. A lot of what we were working on for this iteration is going to leave room for really fun, and new improvements in the next iteration and beyond. We did not want to over stress this one iteration, so that we didn't front load the project and not be able to show much improvement down the road. We found that our teamwork for this iteration was also very good. Everyone has done a good job of communicating when things were done or when needing help. The ideas that everyone is able to come up are ones that everyone can work off of. The "juice" of the game has a good start, and we are looking forward to expanding on that.
